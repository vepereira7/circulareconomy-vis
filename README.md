# Circular Economy

This project was carried out as part of the Data Visualisation and Preparation course and the main goal was to design interesting and meaninful visualizations. Our data can be found [here](https://www.pordata.pt).

## Introduction
As the years progress, a topic that is always addressed in a discussion about the general state of the world is pollution as it is in constant growth, and the reuse of material. In this matter, we wanted to obtain information on the state of the circularity culture in our country compared to others, as well as the European Union and on the economy. Our objective is to provide some interesting and easy to interpret visualizations for a better understanding of the topic in hand.
